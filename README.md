the purpose of this respiratory is to show you how to do binary addition  so the way to do it is pick a number and divide it by 2 multiple times until its 2/1 and you will end up with a bunch of zeros and ones but then you solve it all and you eventually get your answer.

so with these if you can see them youll see how a half adder is 
making it will include wires aligator clips electricity and etc 
the current will flow throught the wires and to the light turning it on if its not built right it won't come on and be faulty and act weird.    It might look complicated but it's not  if you have the right combinations. Each will be different and react different but it won't.               as a breif recap for binary numbers they conist only of 0s and 1s which is not like decimal numbers and are slightly different when it comes to the range of numbers it can go to.
last thing is that binary numbers are a small set of digits and whatever number you'll get you can add that to another number but it wouldn't be the way like  1-10 if you get a 3 you'll carry the one to the next set of numbers and place a one underneath the previous set. 
here is a truth table. It's bassically a mathmatical tables used in logic and is helpful in binary addition.
